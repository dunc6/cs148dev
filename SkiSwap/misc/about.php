        I am a Junior at UVM currently studying Geography and Computer but I
really came to Vermont for the skiing! I am a fully qualified ski instructor, but having 
grown up in England all of my ski experiences prior to College were spent in the French 
Alpes. I believe everyone needs a passion and for me that passion is skiing! That’s why 
we devised Ski Swap. Considering skiing is an expensive sport, Ski Swap is a site that 
facilitates the trading of ski gear to help normal people get onto the  slopes.

        Duncan Whitaker is a junior at The University of Vermont. He has been skiing for 11
years and snowboarding for one. He frequently hits the mountain with cofounder Collin 
Turner and roommate Ray Belanger-Deloge. When not doing computer science projects, 
you’ll find him skiing tree lines at Stowe Mountain Resort. He grew a passion for the 
snow in middle school, where he joined the ski club. Through the club he met like-
minded skiers and boarders that helped him grow not only as a skier, but also as a person. 
Duncan already has two days under his belt and is planning on many more.
