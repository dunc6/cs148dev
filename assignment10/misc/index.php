    <p><br>Skomer -  I am a Junior at UVM currently studying Geography and Computer but I
 really came to Vermont for the skiing! I am a fully qualified ski instructor, but having 
 grown up in England all of my ski experiences prior to College were spent in the French 
 Alpes. I believe everyone needs a passion and for me that passion is skiing! That‚Äôs why 
 we devised Ski Swap. Considering skiing is an expensive sport, Ski Swap is a site that 
 facilitates the trading of ski gear to help normal people get onto the  slopes.</p>

    <p>Collin - "He's said to be hilarious. A humble man who has been snowboarding 
        for the better part of his life. Seeing his face light up as he cruises 
        down the mountain is how you know he lives for the lifestyle. The 'pow' 
        life is the life for him. Every chance possible he is on the slopes. When 
        it comes to boarding he's picking some of the most difficult tree lines 
        I've seen. If you asked him how much he loves the sport he would probably 
        respond, 'really really.' Apart from shredding the gnar he's very studious, 
        studying computer science at the University of Vermont. His leisure time 
        consists of chilling with friends, movies, and kicking it with the ladies.¬†
        Lastly, Collin is someone who can easily brighten your day. With his charming 
        good looks and positive attitude, he really brings a lot to the table."<br>

    <p>Duncan - "Duncan Whitaker is a junior at The University of Vermont. He has been skiing for 11
years and snowboarding for one. He frequently hits the mountain with cofounder Collin 
Turner and roommate Ray Belanger-Deloge. When not doing computer science projects, 
you‚Äôll find him skiing tree lines at Stowe Mountain Resort. He grew a passion for the 
snow in middle school, where he joined the ski club. Through the club he met like-
minded skiers and boarders that helped him grow not only as a skier, but also as a person. 
Duncan already has two days under his belt and is planning on many more." <br> - Shaun White</p>
